# Selenium Locator Strategy: Label

This is a Selenium Extension that locates elements by the text in their associated labels. Please refer to [Locating Elements by Label Text](http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/locateByLabelText)
for further information and the original version of the plugin.

This repository hosts the relevant files for the blog posts about Locator Strategies that I have written [here](http://blog.codecentric.de).
